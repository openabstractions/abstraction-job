// Discovery over local IPC, in C++ — the client half only.
//
// `docs/discovery-ipc.md` and `docs/service-topology.md` are the contract. This
// is written against those two documents and against nothing else: it does not
// read the Python client in abstraction-download, and that one does not read
// this. Where the two agree, the contract said enough. Where they had to agree
// by accident, that is a hole in the contract and is written up rather than
// quietly patched over here.
//
//     using namespace abstraction::discovery;
//     switch (ask(store_root, "abstraction.downloads")) {
//         case Answer::Present:      /* hand the work over            */ break;
//         case Answer::Incompatible: /* a NEWER supervisor. Do NOT    */ break;
//         case Answer::Absent:       /* nobody listening. The ordinary
//                                       case, and not an error        */ break;
//     }
//
// Three things this deliberately is not:
//
//   * Not a server. Only a supervisor listens and the supervisor is Go, so
//     asking never creates an endpoint and there is no listener in this file.
//   * Not a source of exceptions. Absence is what a machine without a
//     supervisor looks like, which is most machines; a caller forced to write a
//     try/catch has been handed an error where the answer was "no". Nothing
//     here throws, including on a malformed registry or a hostile response.
//   * Not a cache. `present` was true for the length of a connection that is
//     already closed.
//
// # Why this lives in its own library and not in abstraction::job
//
// The contract says discovery belongs to the download layer and that nothing in
// `job` may depend on it. This repository is where the C++ toolchain already
// is, so the code sits here — but as `abstraction::discovery`, in a separate
// target that `abstraction_job` does not link and that does not link
// `abstraction_job`. The dependency the contract forbids therefore cannot be
// formed by accident, and moving these three files to the download repository
// later is a `git mv` and two CMake lines.
