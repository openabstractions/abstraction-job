// Store is where jobs live, and it is the interface this server can implement
// for itself.
//
// # Why this is an interface at all
//
// It is the SEMANTICS of the lease protocol and nothing else: a claim is
// exclusive, an epoch only ever increases, every write presents the epoch it
// holds, and a successor continues only from what a predecessor proved. Not one
// clause of that mentions a byte, a file or a directory.
//
// # What this is NOT for, having checked
//
// The plan was that Lemonade's own engine (include/lemon/jobs/) would implement
// this and there would be one job system instead of two. It cannot, and the
// reason is worth writing down rather than rediscovering.
//
// That engine has named steps, a cursor, ops in a pluggable registry, and a
// pause/interrupt/resume lifecycle persisted across a restart. What it does not
// have, anywhere in its headers, is a lease, an epoch, an owner or a claim —
// zero occurrences of any of them. It is a SINGLE-PROCESS orchestrator: this
// server owns every job it knows about, so there is nothing to be exclusive
// against and no need for any of that.
//
// Our contract is strictly stronger, and the extra part is the whole point: work
// survives the process that asked for it and can be adopted by a supervisor, or
// by a daemon on a NAS. An adapter would have to fabricate a lease it could not
// honour, and a fabricated lease is exactly the two-owners damage the lease
// exists to prevent.
//
// So the layering is the other way round from what integrating.md guessed:
//
//     their engine   the ORCHESTRATOR — steps, ops, the pause button, the UI
//     this Store     the SUBSTRATE    — durable, cross-process, adoptable
//
// A download op in their engine submits here and observes; their pause and
// resume become set_intent, which is precisely why schema 4 added it. That is
// one executor, which was the requirement, without pretending a single-process
// manager can arbitrate between machines.
//
// The interface still earns its place: it is what lets a service binding replace
// the file one later without a caller noticing. But in C++ it has ONE
// implementation today, and calling that an abstraction would be premature.
