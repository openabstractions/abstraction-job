// job — a handle to work that is happening somewhere else.
//
// This is the C++ side of an abstraction that already exists in Go and in
// Python. The three are not ports of one another and are not generated from a
// shared IDL. They agree about one thing: the record on disk, and the rules for
// taking ownership of it. The API here looks like C++; the bytes are the
// contract.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT KNOW: what the work IS. `spec` and `checkpoint` are opaque
// and `kind` says who may read them. A download's artifact, sources and sink
// live in a download's spec, not here — which is why downloading can grow
// mirrors and chunk manifests without the record every language must agree
// about changing underneath them.

// to a record needs the lease, and whoever wants a change is almost never
// holding it — a person clicks cancel in this server's UI while a supervisor on
// another machine moves the bytes. Before this field that was inexpressible,
// and the only alternative was to steal the job, which is the single thing the
// lease exists to prevent.
//
// Every system that has met this problem separates desired from observed:
// Kubernetes has spec against status with a deletionTimestamp anyone may set,
// Temporal records cancellation-requested apart from the run state, BITS
// exposes a state its own service polls.
//
// The rules, which are the contract rather than this implementation's habits:
//
//   1. Anyone may write it, lease or no lease. It is the ONE field exempt.
//   2. Only the lease holder may write `state`. Unchanged.
//   3. An owner MUST check it at least as often as it checkpoints and move
//      toward it. An owner that reads a record and ignores this is not an
//      implementation of this abstraction.
//   4. Cancel must be honoured by everything; stopping is universal.
//   5. Pause must be honoured by implementations that advertise it. One that
//      cannot must FAIL the job with a reason rather than carry on, because a
//      pause that quietly does nothing is worse than a refusal.
//   6. A paused job is NOT an orphan — see FileStore::orphans.
