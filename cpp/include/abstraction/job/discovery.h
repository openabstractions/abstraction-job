// Which downloader this machine has, discovered rather than configured.
//
// The download layer moves bytes with libcurl, which stops when this process
// stops. On a machine where a system downloader is running, the same transfer
// can outlive Lemonade entirely — and on a machine where one is not, nothing
// should change.
//
// So this is a provider question, not a feature flag. The caller asks "is there
// a better downloader here?" and gets an answer derived from the machine, never
// from a setting a user had to find. Nothing in Lemonade names a NAS, a
// service, or a host: the supervisor decides where the work actually goes, one
// hop further down, and this layer does not know or care.
//
// Discovery has two steps and both are file reads:
//
//   1. The machine's store, from the location the OS designates for
//      configuration. Whatever set a system downloader up wrote it there once,
//      and every process afterwards reads it.
//   2. A heartbeat in that store. A supervisor refreshes it on every sweep, so
//      a timestamp -- not a pid -- is what proves one is alive now.
//
// A pid file would only prove a process existed when the file was written. The
// heartbeat also carries the interval it promises, so a reader can decide what
// stale means without guessing.
